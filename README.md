# Week9CyberSecurity

There were not too many issues that I experienced when working with this assignment aside from getting the Json file to go onto my computer. The instructions were unclear and i did not recieve any feedback. So, This is my second time wrinting this up and if possible, I will submit the Json file along with this project. I deployed mhn-honeypot-1. After enabling the http on the browser(Instructions not provided) I followed the step by step guide on getting the honeypot to work. Currently withing the past 24 hours I've recieved 5,936 attacks at the time of 2:15. I have some images of the milestones and relevant images pertaining to the assignment. I did not understand the data I've collected at all. But feel free to reference my other images.
